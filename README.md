## Requirements

IMPORTANT: You don't have to make a generic blog with posts. It can be ANYTHING! So long as you are able to comment on it, it could be recipes, reviews, products, job listings, podcast episodes, movies etc etc etc

🎯 Created using create-next-app

🎯 Design a SQL schema for a posts table, and a comments table that has a post_id column connecting it to the posts table.

🎯 Either create a form where users can add posts OR seed your database with at least 4 posts that comments can be added to (if you do the seed, one of the stretch goals will be harder).

🎯 Add a form to the individual post page to allow creating a new comment, which is saved to the new comments table including the Post ID.

🎯 Refresh the /posts route data when adding a new post, and redirect the user to the list of posts

🎯 Refresh the /post/:postId route when adding a new comment, so the new comment is displayed on the page

🎯 Add static and dynamic metadata to your pages

## Stretch Goals

🏹 Add a categories table to allow categorisation of posts at creation time using a dropdown menu. Add a /categories route that lists all categories, and a /categories/:id route that lists all posts in a category.

🏹 Add a new /posts/:id/edit route that allows editing a post. Populate the form with the post data, and save changes by updating the post in the database with a server action.

🏹 Add a delete button to the post page that removes the post from the database.

🏹 Add a new /posts/:id/comments/:id/edit route that allows editing a comment. Populate the form with the comment data, and save changes by updating the comment in the database with a server action.

## From Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
